#AnticanNet
A graph neural network -based prediction model for anticancer small molecules 
#1.Description
This flowchart presents a complete pipeline for anticancer small molecule activity prediction, consisting of four core stages. First, relevant data are collected from the PubChem BioAssay and CTD databases to construct a dataset of small molecule samples for training and testing. Next, during the feature engineering stage, SMILES representations are processed in two ways: molecular descriptors and high-dimensional features are extracted using PaDEL and ChemGPT, while RDKit is used to generate ECFP fingerprints, and Tanimoto similarity is calculated to construct a weighted molecular graph, resulting in the feature matrix and adjacency matrix required for graph neural networks. Then, a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is applied to extract high-level structural features of the molecules, uncovering potential relationships between structure and activity. Finally, in the prediction phase, a fully connected neural network combined with a Sigmoid function is used for binary classification, where a predicted probability â‰¥ 0.5 indicates a positive (active) compound. This integrated approach leverages multi-source features and graph-based modeling to achieve efficient and accurate prediction of anticancer activity in small molecules.
